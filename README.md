## Project

We are going to control the robot arm with an VR controller and have a camera on a gimbal that has 3 axes (pitch, yaw, roll) with stepper motors to control the rotation with the VR headset.
Purpose of this project is to create a robot that can be teleoperated with Virtual Reality
## Hardware
- Raspberry pi 4
- arduino cnc shield v3
- 3 A4988 stepper motor driver
- 2 HD USB cameraes
- 3 stepper motors
- HTC VIVE PRO 2 (We have tested with 1)
- 2 VR controllers
- 4 VR base stations
## Plugins/Libraries for Unity (Unity version 2021.3.18f1)
- SteamVR
- MJPEG stream decoder by <a href="https://gist.github.com/lightfromshadows/79029ca480393270009173abc7cad858" target="_blank">lightfromshadows</a>
## Libraries for Raspberry pi
- <a href="https://github.com/Motion-Project/motion/" target="_blank">Motion</a>
- GPIO
## Robot offline
We use URSim to test the robot movement before we test it on the real robot. This is to see if nothing will break and check that everything will work before we run a real test.
## TODO
- Clean up system
- Combine program
- Add limits and safety features so nothing breaks
